	<h1>About our Production</h1>
	<p>The Real Inspector Hound is a play by writer Tom Stoppard in 1968. The play takes place in the Muldoon Manner, with ten characters but eight actors. The play goes as a mystery theme, with critics Moon and Birdboot examing the movie, but towards the end of the play, they end up inside the scenes they were critiquing! The idea of a play within a play will have both scenes going on simultaneously, as when the critics talk, the people in the play move, but do not speak, while when the people in the movie talk, the critics will not talk but watch. Our show will take place on one stage, with two sceneries in it!  </p>
