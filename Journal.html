<p>Hi, my name is Hayden. So far entering the second month of school, in computer science, we have learnd about naviagting through terminal, using sublime text to make websites, and making a person card using image codes and code pen. Computer science is a very fun class as being able from scratch to make your personal creations is really cool. The first class, when I learned just how to code for shapes to show on a screen was really cool and fun. Also, going thorugh terminal is really interesting as from the back of your computer you can navigate your files and even add stuff to the internet. So far I am very comfortable with the material in computer science and it is a lot of fun to do; in and out of school.</p>

<p>So far I have constructed most of my website. I have three links, to this journal, my projects, and home button back to the home page. I also have a image that stretches across the whole page which I like. So far I understand what I am doing in the class and I am excited to create projects and advance my knowledge of computer science. RIght after I finish this entry I am going to go back to terminal to update some changes to my website. I am excited to learn more and create more cool stuff</p>

<p>Recently a few days ago I made my first animation from the article you provided me. I think the code works due to the different things in the process like a keyframe. Keyframe animation is used for many cartoons like in disney so using css and animations I was able to animate an object. The animation I made was a rectangle that moved with my projects inside. I made this so when you click on my projects it would be cool to click on as it is moving around the screen.</p>

<p>I just made a javascript animation. I was able to use my mouse to move a picture around a screen. I choose the rock cause he is the rock and the rock is the rock. It is cool that I can move it around and especially since its the rock. Also, it is cool that now I understand how to use Javascript and can use it for future projects and cool animations</p>

<p>I just made a card using Javascript. Using an event listner, I created a clicking function. When I click on an image it switches to another image. The frusturating part was getting the event listner to work as at first my code was not working. It took a little while before my clicking fucntion worked. In the end the code worked and helped me create my 5th project.</p>

<p>I just added to my card project. I add and audio file so when I click on the screen not just an image switches, but an audio plays. First I took the sound from youtube and converted into an mp3 so it would work, as a youtube link would not play a sound for me. Then I id'd the sound so I could refer to it when using the sound in javascript. Then I used a source tag so when I click on the screen the source of audio would be from my mp3 file.</p>

<p>I made a valentines card for steven. I used a function where there was a button that u click and it switches photos. I used a source code for the images, one was steven and one was a heart. I gave it to him and he laughed, so it worked.</p>

<p>Today I decided to switch up my website by making a side bar. The side bar has my normal pages, except when you hover over the projects, you get a drop down. By working with the wp3 website I was able to look at the different functions it takes to make a dropdown bar and a side bar. The side bar was fairly easy to make using code for a sidenav and just styling it with width, height, and more to make it appear. For the dropdown, I had to create a class for a dropdown button and add the links to my projects. Then to make the dropdown effect work, I used javascript. Using var, I asked the document to find the dropdown button. Then I used the content.style.display code to style the formation of the dropdown. While overall it was a lot of code, it was easier than I thought. Also, in a lab with Molly today I made my Logan Paul Mike Tyson game work. When you use certain keys you can drag their images closer together like they are boxing. Maybe I can develop it into a game, but on the dropdown side of things I relized that wp3 is super helpful with code and explanations.</p>

<p>Today was the final CS1 class. So far I have 12 projects, two slides pushed, one for Denise and one for the final project. In CS1 I have learned to code using javascript and css and next year in CS2 I want to learn how to use Python. CS1 was a cool expierence, being able to make projects for whatever your interests were. My favorite project was the first one I made where it was a picture of stuff curry and when you dragged across the screen, his image would multiply, creating what you want. I am really happy I did this class as I was able to put my ideas onto a page. After I push this journal entry, my website will be up to date and I will have everything completed for CS1.</p>
