<h1>Journal Entry</h1>
<h2>10/3/22</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Hayden. So far entering the second month of school, in computer science, we have learnd about naviagting through terminal, using sublime text to make websites, and making a person card using image codes and code pen. Computer science is a very fun class as being able from scratch to make your personal creations is really cool. The first class, when I learned just how to code for shapes to show on a screen was really cool and fun. Also, going thorugh terminal is really interesting as from the back of your computer you can navigate your files and even add stuff to the internet. So far I am very comfortable with the material in computer science and it is a lot of fun to do; in and out of school.</p>

<p>So far I have constructed most of my website. I have three links, to this journal, my projects, and home button back to the home page. I also have a image that stretches across the whole page which I like. So far I understand what I am doing in the class and I am excited to create projects and advance my knowledge of computer science. RIght after I finish this entry I am going to go back to terminal to update some changes to my website. I am excited to learn more and create more cool stuff</p>

<p>Recently a few days ago I made my first animation from the article you provided me. I think the code works due to the different things in the process like a keyframe. Keyframe animation is used for many cartoons like in disney so using css and animations I was able to animate an object. The animation I made was a rectangle that moved with my projects inside. I made this so when you click on my projects it would be cool to click on as it is moving around the screen.</p>

<p>I just made a javascript animation. I was able to use my mouse to move a picture around a screen. I choose the rock cause he is the rock and the rock is the rock. It is cool that I can move it around and especially since its the rock. Also, it is cool that now I understand how to use Javascript and can use it for future projects and cool animations</p>

<p>I just made a card using Javascript. Using an event listner, I created a clicking function. When I click on an image it switches to another image. The frusturating part was getting the event listner to work as at first my code was not working. It took a little while before my clicking fucntion worked. In the end the code worked and helped me create my 5th project.</p>
