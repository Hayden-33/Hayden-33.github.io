<h1>Journal Entry</h1>
<h2>10/3/22</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Hayden. So far entering the second month of school, in computer science, we have learnd about naviagting through terminal, using sublime text to make websites, and making a person card using image codes and code pen. Computer science is a very fun class as being able from scratch to make your personal creations is really cool. The first class, when I learned just how to code for shapes to show on a screen was really cool and fun. Also, going thorugh terminal is really interesting as from the back of your computer you can navigate your files and even add stuff to the internet. So far I am very comfortable with the material in computer science and it is a lot of fun to do; in and out of school.</p>
