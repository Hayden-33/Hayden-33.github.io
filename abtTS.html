	<h1>Who is Tom Stoppard?</h1>
	<p>Tom Stoppard is a legendary playwright, writing dozens of plays, with his first being in 1960 and his most recent in 2020. Stoppard is known for his brilliant writing and style of writing, as Stoppard stays away from standard theatre customs and primarily resides in the experimental side of the theater world. The play our production is based on is The Real Inspector Hound, which Stoppard wrote in 1961. In The Real Inspector Hound, the idea of a play within a play fits under his usual writing regiment, bending the rules of theatre and playing with the audience's mind.</p>
